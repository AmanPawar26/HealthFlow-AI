# 🩺 HealthFlow AI  
**AI Copilot for Doctors – Voice to Structured Prescriptions**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Healthcare consultations are slowed by **fragmented and manual records**.

- **Patients** struggle to manage physical reports and recall past history  
- **Doctors** waste time reviewing scattered records and writing prescriptions manually  
- **Hospitals** face duplicate tests, documentation errors, and poor data visibility  

Doctors spend valuable consultation time on **documentation**, not decision-making.

**HealthFlow AI** is an AI-powered clinical copilot that helps doctors:

- 🎤 Speak naturally during consultation  
- 🧠 Instantly convert voice → structured digital prescription  
- 📄 Generate professional prescription PDFs  
- 📨 Share prescriptions with patients digitally  
- 📚 View patient history during consultation  

We reduce documentation burden so doctors can focus on **clinical care, not paperwork**.
