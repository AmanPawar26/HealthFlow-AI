# 🩺 HealthFlow AI  
**AI Copilot for Doctors – Voice to Structured Prescriptions**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Healthcare consultations are slowed by **fragmented and manual records**.

- **Patients** struggle to manage physical reports and recall past history  
- **Doctors** waste time reviewing scattered records and writing prescriptions manually  
- **Hospitals** face duplicate tests, documentation errors, and poor data visibility  

Doctors spend valuable consultation time on **documentation**, not decision-making.

---

## 💡 Solution – HealthFlow AI

**HealthFlow AI** is an AI-powered clinical copilot that helps doctors:

- 🎤 Speak naturally during consultation  
- 🧠 Instantly convert voice → structured digital prescription  
- 📄 Generate professional prescription PDFs  
- 📨 Share prescriptions with patients digitally  
- 📚 View patient history during consultation  

We reduce documentation burden so doctors can focus on **clinical care, not paperwork**.

## ⚙️ How It Works (MVP Flow)

1. **Patient Registration**  
   Basic details captured: Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, Allergies

2. **Voice Prescription Input**  
   Doctor speaks naturally using **Whisper Flow** voice typing

3. **AI Structuring**  
   AI extracts:
   - Diagnosis  
   - Medications (drug, dose, frequency, duration)  
   - Advice  
   - Follow-up instructions  

4. **Prescription Generation**  
   System formats a clean, professional digital prescription

5. **Patient Notification**  
   Prescription can be saved, printed, or shared digitally

## 🧠 Technology Stack

HealthFlow AI is designed to be **lightweight, fast, and deployable without heavy hospital IT setup**.

### 🖥 Core Frontend Architecture

- **React 19** – Modern component-based UI with efficient rendering  
- **TypeScript** – Strict type safety for patient data and prescription schemas  
- **ES Modules (ESM)** – Dependencies loaded via `esm.sh` for a build-less browser-based workflow  

---

### 🤖 AI & Intelligence

- **Google Gemini API (gemini-3-flash-preview)**  
  - Clinical extraction from voice transcripts into structured JSON  
  - Medical summarization of past visits  
  - Reasoning for formatting prescriptions and follow-up advice  

The AI acts as a **clinical documentation assistant**, not a decision-maker.

---

### 🎨 UI/UX & Design

- **Tailwind CSS** – Professional “Clinical Blue” theme and responsive layouts  
- **Lucide React** – Medical and workflow icons (Stethoscope, Mic, ShieldCheck, etc.)  
- **Inter Font Family** – High legibility for medical environments  

---

### 💾 Data & Infrastructure

- **Web Storage API (LocalStorage)**  
  Stores patient history and UPID records locally on the doctor’s device (no heavy backend required for MVP)

- **Native Browser Print Engine**  
  Generates professional medical PDFs directly from the app

---

### 🌐 Standard Web APIs Used

- `fetch` with retry/backoff for reliable AI communication  
- `navigator.clipboard` for fast text handling  
- Standard DOM events for smooth integration with external voice tools  

---

### 🎙 Workflow Integration

- **Whisper Flow (External Voice Tool)**  
  The app uses standard HTML `<textarea>` elements so doctors can use system-level voice typing (Ctrl + Win) to dictate prescriptions directly into the app.
